Apparently, last year, Mohamed Kane h</span></span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.2;">ad similar thoughts on this at the end of his freshman year. He had the idea of asking his roommate if they could simulate technical interviews, and with this came the birth of 6 Sharp.</span></p>{nl}<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-top: 0pt; margin-bottom: 0pt; margin-left: 320px;">{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p style="margin-left: 320px;">{nl}	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.2; background-color: transparent;">If you haven&rsquo;t heard, 6 Sharp is the new IEEE/ACM committee which started this year and is run by Mohamed. Here is his more detailed account of The 6 Sharp Story:</span></p>{nl}<p style="margin-left: 40px;">{nl}	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.2; background-color: transparent;">In Mohamed&rsquo;s experience, there weren&rsquo;t </span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.2; background-color: transparent;">many existing opportunities for interview prep. The few solutions offered did not give real &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; interview experiences, but were rather just passive ways to help. To confirm this, Mohamed sent out a survey to a group of</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;">course 6 students, and was met with positive and encouraging responses on his idea for a more &lsquo;hands-on&rsquo; interview prep experience. He reached out to IEEE/ACM with his intended project, and the exec loved it, so Mohamed joined the group.</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.2; background-color: transparent;">Building on an idea from scratch is not an easy task. Initially, Mohamed tried creating a website where interviewers and interviewees would be matched. But after a month, he decided to abandon the idea because &ldquo;the logistical coordination was a night</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;">mare&rdquo; and &ldquo;let&#39;s say that MIT students are not really responsive to emails&rdquo;. After that, his next model was for the students to be all gathered in one place at a certain time, and form pairs to simulate interviews and go through questions together. This turne</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;">d out to be a success since the fo</span><span style="background-color: transparent; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; line-height: 1.2; white-space: pre-wrap;">ur meetings had an average of 20 attendees!</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/page1image12464.png" style="width: 333px; float: right; height: 250px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Cambria; font-size: 16px; white-space: pre-wrap; line-height: 1.2; background-color: transparent;">Currently, especially since 6 Sharp is still in its early years, the challenge is to be more systematic and to have more concrete plans for activities and advertising. Also, technical interviews have their peak months. Now, many students have already accepted job offers, so meeting attendance has slowly declined.

1426040127|kasmus|IEEE/ACM Faculty Dinner with Prof. Polina Golland, February 25|<p>{nl}	To start off the spring semester, we had an enjoyable faculty dinner with Prof. Polina Golland. She currently teaches 6.008 (Introduction to Inference) and is primarily involved with research in biomedical image analysis. (Read more here: <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/">http://people.csail.mit.edu/polina/</a>)</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Golland was a delight to have dinner with since she was very open to whatever topic that was brought up and even occasionally caused a chorus of laughter among everyone in the room. The conversation started with mostly her explaining the rotation of classes she and a few other professors teach. Many knew her as the one who taught 6.437 (Inference and Information), but currently, she teaches 6.008. From there, the topics branched out and deepened into how to know which fields to pursue, choosing a useful and interesting research topic, and the importance of new ideas in the field. Golland provided great insight to not just the Course 6 life and the different paths to take in the future, but also life in general, so it was really interesting and enjoyable.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	I&rsquo;d recommend the faculty dinners to everyone if you haven&rsquo;t been to one since there are always useful and interesting stuff to hear (plus, there&rsquo;s always good food)!

Well, to give you an idea:</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		<ul>{nl}			<li>{nl}				At the beginning of the trip I was super excited to see the ALPHA magnetic spectrometer.

We were able to meet and spend many days getting to know an incredibly impressive and friendly group of mechatronics undergraduate and graduate students. This was a great opportunity for us to learn an incredible amount about Austrian culture, and share insight we had into U.S. culture, engineering, and education. We could not have asked for a more welcoming group of people to travel and learn with, and also came away with critical introductory German vocabulary (orangensaft!!).&nbsp;</div>{nl}		<div>{nl}			&nbsp;</div>{nl}	</div>{nl}</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/wendili_blog_pic4.png" style="width: 500px; height: 211px;" /></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		<strong>3.<span class="Apple-tab-span" style="white-space:pre"> </span>Switzerland</strong></div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		Switzerland is beautiful, and it was a pleasure getting to know the country, the culture, the language, the food, and the engineering. We spent a night in Geneva seeing important sites like the United Nations building, and a day in Zurich seeking out chocolate, swans, and parks with giant chess games. In Zurich we also had the pleasure of being welcomed at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH Zurich), one of the top engineering universities in Europe, with notable alumni such as Albert Einstein and John von Neumann. It was a great opportunity to meet students of ETH Zurich, hear about their rich engineering history, and see their beautiful campus. Here is a student exhibit we enjoyed in their main building:</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/wendili_blog_pic5.png" style="width: 375px; height: 500px;" /></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	What a great adventure.

1419033600|Admin|CERN Trip - Keertan Kini|<div>{nl}	First of all, great thanks to IEEE/ACM Exec for organizing and sponsoring the fantastic trip to Switzerland!!!! Speaking as a non-physicist, the technology and scale were still mind-blowing.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Yet while the LHC areas we saw (See ATLAS and CMS) were fantastic, what I found resonated most were the lesser known experiments and history.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Fortunately, or more likely unfortunately for our tour guides, none of us held back our questions.

1419033600|Admin|CERN Trip - Jason Yang|<div>{nl}	In late September we had the wonderful opportunity to visit CERN, funded by IEEE/ACM. This trip was pretty awesome, to say the least. Filled with cool science, great chocolate and&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	awesomely bad puns &ndash; sleep deprived, super corny, bad puns. We started our trip from Logan, flying to Newark and then to Geneva. Pretty simple right? Except that our Geneva flight was delayed for several hours at which point we started getting conCERNed that we wouldn&rsquo;t make it there in time to meet our hosts. (Yes this doesn&rsquo;t sound as funny on paper, but yes we were running on no sleep at this point). I should back up and give a bit more context to this trip. It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to just be a joyride to Switzerland &ndash; our goal was to form an &lsquo;alliance&rsquo; or some sort with a sister school in Austria, JKU Lintz. So just so we could sit around and throw back a few beers with them, so to speak, they invited us to their annual CERN trip&hellip; and to throw back a few actual beers.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	So we get there, late, but nothing too conCERNing. And we meet up with our Austrian hosts. Begin day 1. We haven&rsquo;t slept much and we are only beginning our day. CERN&rsquo;s campus is huge and amazing, and also right smack in the middle of the Swiss-French border which you&rsquo;d think would make customs a nightmare. But I guess that&rsquo;s only the US borders. Here, they have a one room shack set up next to the road and is typically empty and cars just cross freely. Pretty interesting.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	But science! CERN isn&rsquo;t just a place where a bunch of really old physicists with overfull pocket protectors sit around and bicker about the latest particle they found (maybe the last part is correct, not sure) CERN was doing a bunch of cool things. The first day we saw a cryogenic test facility where they test on frozen bodies&hellip; just kidding &ndash; this is where they test magnets before putting them in the supercollider. From here we walked over to the AMS experiment where they are essentially looking for the &lsquo;anti-universe&rsquo; (a universe like ours except comprised entirely of antiparticles. The way this experiment works is that the detector is mounted on the ISS. With some probability, a particle from the anti-universe will exit their universe, fly across the void and enter our universe, keep going traveling though our universe without collisions with any other particle (because then both particles will be annihilated), with some probability, find our solar system, and enter our detector. That&rsquo;s just the hope.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Here we went to the experiment that gets the most attention &ndash; the Atlas experiment. This is the one that uses the huge accelerator. Unfortunately, it was currently down for maintenance but because of that, we could see the innards of the detector. I won&rsquo;t go into detail about how this worked except that the whole thing was HUGE. Lots of superconducting coils with several thousand amperes flowing though fairly thin wires. Just to give an idea of how huge and powerful the entirety of CERN is. You know how graphine is one of the strongest materials known? Imagine a block of it. Now imagine it vaporized by a particle beam. That&rsquo;s pretty much what CERN does on a regular basis when they need to dump the energy beam somewhere.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Another awesome experiment that they were working on over there involved the creation of antimatter. Here at CERN, they produce &lsquo;the highest quality antimatter.&rsquo; The idea here is pretty simple. Just smash things and collect the anti-particles. We even got to hold and touch things that held antimatter at one point.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Here&rsquo;s my overall view of CERN. Nowhere else does science and engineering come together more closely than here. Sure, all of this is derived from theoretical physics, but it takes teams of applied physicists and swaths of engineers to design the apparatuses in order to verify these theories. Because of this team effort, so many breakthroughs not only on the physics stage but even technology (should I mention that the internet and lots of data research is being done here on the side) have happened.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Cern, y&rsquo;all. Visit there.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Jason Yang</div>||||||use_html=1|
1419033600|Admin|Unfathomable Frontiers|<div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		Only in Switzerland, I thought to myself as I crossed the unpatrolled French-Swiss border. Only in Switzerland, where a &ldquo;steinful&rdquo; of beer costs less than a bottle of water. Where a country can be linguistically divided almost perfectly in half. And where some of the most incredible experiments in physics were conducted&mdash;in the middle of a winery.&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		Switzerland is a living, breathing paradox, as I quickly discovered in my four day visit there. The only neutral country in Europe, it uses the outdated Franc to avoid fiscally ties to the European Union. However, it continues to participate in all of the free trade agreements with its neighbouring countries. A peaceful country, it has never participated in any major European wars. But every able-bodied male citizen has served in the military and still owns a military rifle in his home. It&rsquo;s an absolutely gorgeous country that is absolutely united but contains two very distinct regions: the French West and the German East. But regardless of culture, language, and background, Switzerland&rsquo;s CERN laboratory unites the talent of the best physicists and scientists in the world. My two day tour of the facilities revealed some unbelievable facets of CERN&rsquo;s scientific experiments.For one, CERN is an incredible campus, and there&rsquo;s literally no other facility like it in the world. For example, the Large Hadron Collider, the gem of the campus, is 27 kilometers in circumference&mdash;a size unrivaled in the world. As a result, it makes replication and verification of experiments quite difficult. To solve this problem, CERN invented a solution that is very Swiss in nature: put another collider on the other side of the campus and make sure the two teams don&rsquo;t talk to each other but can verify each other&rsquo;s findings. Going from the LHC to ATLAS was in fact very similar to the journey between Geneva and Zurich: it seemed that the scientists had different goals, different projects, and basically spoke different languages (not that I understand when scientists speak in Physics to me anyway). A beautiful harmony of two independent groups of people without which CERN could not exist. It was a smaller version of Switzerland&rsquo;s own incredible marriage of German and French mini-cultures. This harmony of different cultures has fostered the growth of many child projects that are now essential in modern science and engineering.</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		We all know that Al Gore invented the internet, but before he did that, Tim Berners-Lee initiated the ENQUIRE project at CERN. Never heard of it? Well, it turned into the current day World Wide Web. CERN was the site of the first web server, and still continues to host web servers. In fact, about 20% of Europe&rsquo;s modern-day web traffic still goes through CERN servers. The invention of the World Wide Web in itself is an incredible feat, but it&rsquo;s even more impressive to learn that the w3 was invented as a supplement to the physics research at CERN. Yes, the w3 project was a side project to help the transfer of experimental data. Mind blown? Yeah, me too. But it gets more intense.&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		You&rsquo;ve probably heard of the Higgs Boson at this point, and its significance in the explanation of why fundamental particles have mass. This discovery was the result of over 13 years of work at CERN. But this experiment only put a bow on the first of three ultimate goals that CERN hopes to accomplish. Going forward, CERN will continue to run experiments on anti-matter, which would ultimately support the theory of the Big Bang and give some closure to the Baryon asymmetry problem. We know that, if the Big Bang were to have occurred, then there must have been some equal amount of matter and anti-matter that were created. However, so far, we haven&rsquo;t observed large amounts of anti-matter but observed a seemingly expanding amount of matter. Where did the matter come from? Where did the anti-matter go? Perhaps CERN can find these answers in the years to come.For its final goal, CERN looks to the cosmos and tries to decipher the mystery surrounding dark matter. For the moment, dark matter is simply a black box (yes, pun intended) that is the result of invisible mass. It doesn&rsquo;t react to light and is completely inactive. Research on it has provided more questions than answers in recent years, and CERN has made it an objective to understand the significance and formation of dark matter.</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		Between the three goals, CERN attempts to answer questions of the Earth and the cosmos in the past, present, and future. With facilities and resources unavailable anywhere else in the world, CERN is our best shot at discovering the deepest secrets of modern science. My visit opened my eyes to the scores of independent experiments being conducted there, and the incredible contributions that it has already made to modern-day physics and engineering. So by the end of my trip to Switzerland, I added another &ldquo;only in Switzerland&rdquo; to my list. Only in Switzerland, the unification of Germans, Americans, French, Austrians, Russians, the marriage of different thought processes and philosophies, the creation of a 27 kilometre tunnel, the relaying of particles over 730 kilometres from Switzerland to Italy at 99.9999999% of the speed of light. All in the hope of taking science to new, unfathomable frontiers.</div>{nl}</div>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>||||||use_html=1|

But that&rsquo;s what happened on our trip to CERN.&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	The first day we met up with our soon-to-be best buds from Austria, and we traveled together to CERN for our first round of tours. The majority of the time we were led around by a retired physicist, Peter. He was awesome. When we first got there, someone asked him why CERN was created. He said there were three reasons:</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	To find the Higgs Boson.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	To prove or disprove the theory of supersymmetry.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&ldquo;To find whatever there is.&rdquo;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	The third point made me laugh, but it&rsquo;s totally true. The culture at CERN is one of ferocious curiosity. They are passionate about figuring out how the universe works on the most basic level. And they&rsquo;re doing it.&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	This is a picture of one of the crown jewels of CERN: CMS.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span id="docs-internal-guid-d6ad4a5b-1fd9-4050-e046-9562c806aa95"><span style="font-size: 15px; font-family: Arial; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap; background-color: transparent;"><img height="281px;" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/tWJ_wrYinLQvBQ1_mrhEhPf3r1L9wAaN3xAs2Sj33XoBo-fJ35jE3KH8jc_UHlaiH4a0w6CvMwDK-ZZEkOyySS-AYuFNUDGM-wgI7B2l8TpIsE2VGvhLgZA77CWx7EhQkQ" style="border: none; transform: rotate(0.00rad); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad);" width="624px;" /></span></span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	CMS is one of two particle detectors. Along with ATLAS, they make up the &ldquo;eyes&rdquo; of the LHC (Large Hadron Collider). There were way too many things I learned that were completely mind-blowing, and I don&rsquo;t have room to write all of them. But here are a few:</div>{nl}<ul>{nl}	<li>{nl}		The LHC accelerates &ldquo;small&rdquo; clouds of 100 billion particles at a time in rapid succession. Each time these clouds pass by each other, 10 particles collide. That comes out to 14 million collisions per second.</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		Contrary to popular belief, particles don&rsquo;t smash together and create debris that physicists study. The energy of the particles (which are traveling at 99.99999991% the speed of light) goes E=MC^2 and gets converted to mass. That conversion creates elementary particles, literally out of thin air, which physicists are interested in studying (for obvious reasons).</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		They make anti-matter. Enough said.</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		The raw data collected from ATLAS and CMS (the two detectors) comes out to about one pedabyte (1 million GB) per second. That&rsquo;s equivalent to the total identifyable storage capacity of the human brain, every two seconds. Talk about a lot of data.</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		ATLAS is as heavy as the Eiffel Tower and creates a magnetic field of 2 Tesla.</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		In order to create that magnetic field, 13,000 amps run through a series of superconductive wire, which is cooled by liquid helium.</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		Why is our universe only made of matter? Who knows. There could be an &ldquo;anti-universe&rdquo; out there somewhere.&nbsp;</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		The internet was invented at CERN.</li>{nl}	<li>{nl}		There could be antigravity with antimatter, but we can&rsquo;t know for sure because the electromagnetic forces on antihydrogen are far too strong.</li>{nl}</ul>{nl}<div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		I hope that gives you a taste. It was insane how much I learned about particle physics, and not from a lecture. Just from walking around the facility, talking to people who absolutely love what they do.&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		&nbsp;</div>{nl}	<div>{nl}		<div>{nl}			CERN is a lab like no other, in a location equally epic. As we flew across Ireland and the UK, crossing the English Channel, making our way to Switzerland, dreary clouds were all we saw of Europe. Then as we crossed over into Swiss air, I saw them. The majestic peaks of the Swiss Alps, piercing through the clouds. It was breathtaking.

1410217252|Admin|Natalie (Manting) Lao's Summer in NY|<p>{nl}	I hope everyone had a refreshing and relaxing summer! Our IEEE/ACM exec has been planning lots of exciting events for this semester and we&#39;ll keep you posted in the upcoming weeks. I am a rising junior at MIT this semester and it will be my 3rd year in IEEE/ACM and my first year as co-president. I look forward to working with exec and you all to bring social and academic events to Course 6 students. I had a fantastic internship at the General Electric Company&#39;s Power &amp; Water division this summer in Schenectady, New York. I participated in the IT Leadership Program for the Renewables business as a Mobile and Field Services Lead. I took a project management role and all of the projects I managed were related to the wind energy business, an area of work that I have been interested in since high school. I worked in this beautiful building (the newest one on the GE campus! It has a 4-story-tall wind turbine INSIDE with an almost 50 meter long blade on the lawn):</p>{nl}<p style="text-align: center;">{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/natalie1.png" style="width: 400px; height: 267px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	I led two main projects: one involved transitioning a wind farm construction process from old scanners and piles of paper-and-pencil forms to an iOS application in order to increase productivity and lean down the process; the other involved overseeing and PMing the development of an iPad application by two remote teams - one in India and the other in Mexico - for a group of end users in Brazil.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	For my first project, I was given a week-long opportunity to travel to an actual GE wind farm to facilitate the initial pilots of our new iOS application. I was able to train the end users, collect feedback, and explore ways to expand this project to all domestic GE wind parks and even internationally. Being able to see the inner workings of how massive wind turbines and wind farms are constructed was an amazing and eye-opening experience. At the end of the week, we were able to estimate around 20 hours/week of productivity saved per site with our new iOS process!</p>{nl}<p style="text-align: center;">{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/natalie2.png" style="width: 450px; height: 338px;" /></p>{nl}<div>{nl}	Wind turbines right after a thunderstorm, Colorado. This internship experience was the most I could&#39;ve hoped for in a PM role. I was given the reins on projects that actually had a direct impact on the company&#39;s budget and profts &amp; losses, which is exciting for any college intern. I also&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	connected with many amazing mentors at GE - I really loved the inclusive, nurturing culture. There were many industry leaders that were willing to take time out of their days to mentor me and help me develop as a professional. I would highly recommend GE and the ITLP internship program to anyone interested in leadership in tech.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Aside from work, I also had lots of fun exploring the nearby tourist attractions.

1392230828|kasmus|Chen Dan Dong's Trip to the Joint Mathematics Meetings Conference|<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:12px;">Thanks to Chen Dan for writing up a blog post about her trip to and presentation at the</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:12px;">JMM in Baltimore! &nbsp;Chen Dan&#39;s trip was sponsored in part by our own <a href="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/events.html#6cents">Six Cents program</a>.</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">A few weeks ago, I attended and presented at ASM/MAA Joint Mathematics Meetings (JMM)</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">at Baltimore, MD, the largest mathematics meeting in the world. I presented the project which I&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">worked on last summer in an REU program called RIPS (Real Industrial Program for Students)&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">at UCLA. I presented this project along with the other two team members.</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;"><img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/1.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" />&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">This project was about developing a software prototype for Intel, which can identify crystal&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">type (Bravais Lattice) and crystal orientation (Miller Index) for any poly-crystalline material&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">given only atomic positions. We took a novel approach which enables us to identify different&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">regions in poly-crystalline structures (including amorphous regions) within a range of tolerance&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">(which users can define). As far as we know, our software is the first software that successfully&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">characterizes poly-crystalline structures. On the presentation day, I was a little nervous (and I&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">should be), but we did a good job on delivering our project to the audience. <a href="http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/amsmtgs/2160_abstracts/ 1096-82-1331.pdf">Here is the link of&nbsp;</a></span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;"><a href="http://jointmathematicsmeetings.org/amsmtgs/2160_abstracts/ 1096-82-1331.pdf">the abstract of our presentation</a>. If you are interested in learning more about our project, feel free </span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">to contact&nbsp;me.&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">Besides presenting our project, I also attended several interesting talks. For example, one&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">presentation was about whether math can help you make money. A mathematician from Florida&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">State University used Hidden Markov Chain to predict high frequency trading. </span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">The application of her model gave impressive results &ndash; a return of as high as 70%.

As the electrical grid increases in size, a good strategy that reduces&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">the size of the simulation space is to group generators with similar behavior. The researcher&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">evaluated three clustering technique &ndash; spectral clustering, modularity clustering, and k-</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">means clustering. The knowledge on graph theory is heavily utilized.

For example, a huge Exhibits and Book&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">Sales happened on the first day of JMM. There were hundreds of booths for&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">schools, companies and publishers across the nation. Also, there was a special session during&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">the exhibits about mathematical arts. I was impressed by the fact that math and&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">beauty actually closely relate to each other.</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;"><img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/3.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;"><img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/4.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;"><img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/5.jpg" style="width: 800px; height: 600px;" /></span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">In summary, the trip to JMM was really a great experience for me. I saw a lot of cutting-edge&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">research/projects that were going on in other schools (or other countries). I definitely learnt a lot.&nbsp;</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">Finally, thank IEEE/ACM&rsquo;s Six Cents program for sponsoring my trip!</span></div>||||||use_html=1|
1391878542|quanquan|Quanquan's IAP at MIT|<p>{nl}	Hope everyone had a relaxing, exciting, and sleep-filled (?) IAP! We&#39;re planning lots of exciting events for the spring semester (as well as continuing our course 6 study breaks) and we&#39;ll certainly keep you posted for the upcoming weeks.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	This is my third year at MIT, and it&#39;s the third IAP I&#39;ve spent at MIT. The previous two IAPs, I mostly took classes, did research, participated in a couple of competition. But this IAP, I did a bit of coding mostly on a couple of side projects and fixing up<a href="http://picker.mit.edu"> Course Picker&nbsp;</a>&nbsp;which will hopefully be launched this afternoon! But if I talked about this, it&#39;ll mostly be pictures of this:</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/photo%20(62).JPG" style="width: 320px; height: 240px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	and this:</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/photo%20(63).JPG" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	My view out of stata.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	So not terribly exciting if I wrote about this for an entire blog post.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	But other than spending my days coding, I also did a bunch of random activities around campus. Here&#39;s a few of the things I did (not in any particular order):&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<strong style="font-size: 12px;">Warren Dixon Lecture:&nbsp;</strong>This was an MIT IEEE/ACM sponsored event where Prof. Dixon of the University of Florida gave a lecture on the topic of nonlinear controls and robotics. &nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/photo%20(60).JPG" style="width: 500px; height: 373px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/photo%20(59).JPG" style="width: 500px; height: 669px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	If you&#39;re interested in this kind of research, check out Prof. Dixon&#39;s<a href="http://www.mae.ufl.edu/People/Person.aspx?id=80"> page</a>. The talk&#39;s out my comfort zone so I unfortunately can&#39;t offer more than a brief or (or uh...nonexistent) summary, but MIT IEEE/ACM is planning to host more talks this semester in all areas of research so come to one that you&#39;re interested in!</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<strong style="font-size: 12px;">Bad Ideas Week:&nbsp;</strong><span style="font-size: 12px;">So East Campus every year has this Bad Ideas week where they host a set of activities that are supposedly &quot;bad ideas.&quot; I went to a couple this year. The first is shooting down quadcopters with potato cannons. Just to give you an idea of exactly what we were doing, we were shooting down these:</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/shopping.jpeg" style="width: 250px; height: 193px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	with homemade (EC-made) these:</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/81404961_640.jpg" style="width: 300px; height: 169px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Not to mention that the quadcopters were flown by us, inexperienced MIT students who kept flying them into walls, other quadcopters, and people. Unfortunately, I didn&#39;t get an actual picture of me flying a quadcopter or shooting a canon because I was too preoccupied with avoiding getting hit in the head by a wandering quadcopter.&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	The other event I went to and didn&#39;t (unfortunately) participate was human dogsledding. What I can say was that it was freezing, dark, and one of the sleds broke midrun so there was a whole fiasco about that.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<strong>Trash Can Drumming:&nbsp;</strong>I also did trash can drumming which was taught by a couple of MIT students, Rupak Chakraborty and Nich Uhlenhuth. There&#39;s a couple of videos floating around on Youtube of the class playing trash can drums, but I&#39;m too self-conscious&nbsp;to put them up. So you&#39;ll have to deal with only a still:</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/Screen%20shot%202014-02-08%20at%2012.03.28%20PM.png" style="width: 500px; height: 313px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Focusing very intently, yes.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<strong>Live Action Mafia:&nbsp;</strong>Every semester and IAP, Randomites host a two to three week long Live Action Mafia game. This is the first time I played and I got pretty into it. I mean who doesn&#39;t like paranoia and finding out everyone you trusted turned out to be Mafia? And you also get access to this forum where discussions and suspicions get passed around:</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/quanquan/Public/IAP2014/Screen%20shot%202014-02-08%20at%2012.36.40%20PM.png" style="width: 700px; height: 340px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Yep, Mafia won this IAP.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<strong style="font-size: 12px;">HTML5/CSS/Javascript Game Design Workshop:&nbsp;</strong>I also helped teach this week-long IAP workshop with Irene and Qian. Teaching is always fun, debugging programs not so much. Also got a chance to develop <a href="http://quanquan.scripts.mit.edu/pong/">this</a> a couple of hours before class as a demonstration of a game with game physics.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	So yeah, that was my IAP. I&#39;m sure I left out other things I did because I can&#39;t remember them at this moment. It&#39;s definitely worth it to spend at least one IAP enjoying MIT culture because there&#39;s a ton to do on campus!</p>||||||use_html=1|

Nobody believed that it was possible, but I did it and it was a huge success. When I gave my talk at the conference, there was not enough room to fit everyone who wanted to listen so I had to give my talk again.&rdquo; He also talked about the latest technology and trend in circuit design. Right now we can drive chips with uW level energy. It is incredible because with such low energy consumption rate, it is possible to run the chip entirely with energy harvested from the environment. &ldquo;Think about a hearing aid with no battery!&rdquo; he said. </span></span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/anantha_lecturing.JPG" style="width: 800px; height: 449px;" /></p>{nl}<p dir="ltr" style="line-height:1;margin-top:0pt;margin-bottom:0pt;">{nl}	<span id="docs-internal-guid-531f89ec-14de-d961-7dee-2887d5960ae8"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Cambria; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">At the dinner table, Professor Chandrakasan had lively conversation with students. &ldquo;How about we have an EECS lounge for students to hang out and study?&rdquo; He asked students about their opinion of a new idea that is developed in USAGE. &ldquo;Sometimes I wish I could know more about the classes; it&rsquo;s so hard to choose classes just from the descriptions on the subject listing,&rdquo; one student said. &ldquo;How about we create a panel where professors talk about their classes?&rdquo; Everyone was excited about the idea and people started talking about the possible format of the panel. Some suggested that it should be a lightning talk where each professor is given less than 3 minutes, while others suggested that it could be a debate, or &ldquo;course war,&rdquo; as professors advocate enthusiastically for their classes in order to attract as much interest as possible. </span></span></p>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/uploads/dinner_group.JPG" style="width: 800px; height: 449px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span id="docs-internal-guid-531f89ec-14df-05fe-2b16-972d7de401ea"><span style="font-size: 16px; font-family: Cambria; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: transparent; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;">When asked about how he got started in a research career, Professor Chandrakasan said it started as a summer UROP experience at Berkeley. The Berkeley UROP program was not nearly as good as the UROP program at MIT now, he said. It was also the motivation for him to start the SuperUROP program at MIT. &nbsp;&ldquo;It is really important to get research experience as an undergrad so that you know what you want to focus on later,&rdquo; he explained. </span></span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Thanks so much to Professor Chandrakasan and all of you who came to the dinner for making it an awsome event!</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	[Story by Jason Wu]</p>||||||use_html=1|

1382506733|Admin|Sid's Adventures...|<p>{nl}	Hi MIT IEEE/ACM, I&#39;m Sid, and I&#39;m a Haskell enthusiast.<br />{nl}	A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to attend a few of the conferences following the International Conference on Functional Programming (or ICFP) in Boston. These included HOPE (Higher-Order Programming with Effects), FARM (Functional Art, Music, Modeling and Design), and a few others on topics like Erlang and compiler research. One main focus of the conferences, of course, was on ``beautiful&#39;&#39; programs coded in Haskell.<br />{nl}	I found FARM to be the most interesting conference and spent most of my time there. Most of the presentations were about synthesizing music that sounded like that made by human composers, although there were a few non-music projects too.<br />{nl}	The first one that caught my eye (ear?) was on synthesizing music that was based on repetitions but would make one small change each cycle. I missed the earlier part of his demo (I was at HOPE before then), but it was based on arranging a predetermined set of notes as states in a graph and looking for cycles. Every few repeats, a modification would be made to the cycle, and the result was music that sounded natural and lively. Apparently, he had also been able to get people to dance to his music. His next step was in incorporating genetic algorithms into his code, and he had a very simple way of doing it. When examining natural language, there is a general trend that the second most common letter is half as frequent as the most common, the third most common is a third as frequent as the most common, etc. According to him, music by human composers also follows this pattern, so one fitness function could be based on this surprisingly simple characteristic.<br />{nl}	Another related demo was based on treating music like a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">context-free grammar</a>. You start with a random series of chords, which are multiple notes played at the same time. Then, using specific pre-defined rules that preserve the total duration of the notes, you replace each note with new some new notes however many times as necessary (essentially an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system">L system</a>). Surprisingly, if you pick the right rules, you can generate music like the following:<br />{nl}	<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/98400395" width="100%"></iframe>Notice that you have similar sounds (in that relative notes and durations are the same) but with different pitches each time, which is a function of the grammar that was used to generate the music. Given that you know the rules, then you can potentially generate music from any genre possible. That is one of the goals of the presenter: she wants to incorporate machine learning to find out the grammars of various genres of music and make music that is even more realistic.<br />{nl}	The rules that she used to generate her music when she demoed it at FARM were taken from a textbook. Some of the rules overlap, so there is a probability assigned to each rule. A generative algorithm picks a rule at random (weighted by their respective probabilities) on each round and applies it to the music until something like the following is produced:<br />{nl}	<iframe frameborder="no" height="166" scrolling="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/tracks/103489766" width="100%"></iframe>(Both samples taken from her <a href="https://soundcloud.com/donyaquick">Soundcloud page</a>)<br />{nl}	At one point, she compared her algorithmic music with a real piece of classical music (both in a similar style), and it was incredible how spot-on her music was.<br />{nl}	This was, of course, all written in Haskell.<br />{nl}	But the conference wasn&#39;t just about music. There was a presentation by Brent Yorgey, the main organizer of the conference, about a new animations package he had made which was based on an old diagrams package he had written earlier. His diagrams package was essentially a domain-specific language based on Haskell that could create diagrams in a vein similar to the <a href="http://www.texample.net/tikz/examples/">tikz package</a> from LaTeX. His animations package extended diagrams and allowed the construction of animations. You could specify what was rotating, what was moving (and how), and you could glue animations together or splice them. One of his key insights was that an animation shouldn&#39;t necessarily have a beginning or an end. They should be infinitely long, and in the end you should be able to splice out only the segments that you need. Haskell&#39;s lazy evaluation feature, in which things are only evaluated when needed, allows you to create things like infinitely long lists (as long as you only require a finite segment of it at a time). The idea of infinitely long animations plays very well to one of Haskell&#39;s most useful features. This way of looking at animations also allows you to not have to worry about when an animation ends or when it starts all the time: you only have to worry about it at the end, when you choose which segments of the animation you want.<br />{nl}	He had some interesting demos to show us, like the proof of the Pythagorean theorem (I apologize beforehand for the poor quality of the pictures in this entry):<br />{nl}	<img alt="" src="/blog/uploads/pythag.jpg" style="width: 510px; height: 340px;" /><br />{nl}	Later on, he revealed to us that he&#39;d been talking to one of the members of the conference before his presentation, who showed him that his code had been done completely wrong, but it was very cool nonetheless.<br />{nl}	There was also a demo on rope-tying with Haskell. Using another domain-specific language, you can tell Haskell how to braid multiple pieces of rope together, and it will create a diagram of the final braided product, with the ends tied together for the final touch:<br />{nl}	<img alt="" src="/blog/uploads/braid.jpg" style="width: 510px; height: 340px;" /><br />{nl}	All of this written in about 20 lines of code! Definitely an application of Haskell I hadn&#39;t thought of before.<br />{nl}	The conference ended with a presentation on something entirely different: visualizing arbitrary programs using pictures. His idea was that you start with a few basic combinators: the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SKI_combinator_calculus">S, K, and I combinators</a>. It is known that any program can be written with these three combinators. However, it turns out that you don&#39;t really need the I combinator: you can rewrite it in terms of just the S and K combinators. It also turns out that you can rewrite the S and K combinators in terms of another combinator, called the X combinator or the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iota_and_Jot">iota combinator</a>. Then, you can write programs like the following:<br />{nl}	(X(X(X)))<br />{nl}	But then the parentheses are a bit redundant, so we can choose to keep only the right parentheses:<br />{nl}	XXX)))<br />{nl}	And this almost looks like binary:<br />{nl}	111000<br />{nl}	This is the basis of the Jot programming language. The presenter&#39;s idea was that since Jot programs are just numbers, you can generate arbitrary programs in a two-dimensional plot, and measure how many reductions it takes to get to an answer, which will be represented by a hue in the plot. This generates patterns like this:<br />{nl}	<br />{nl}	It&#39;s incredible that you can use programs to visualize so many things, from the most theoretical, like SKI calculus, to the most practical, like braiding. Before the conference, I never realized how good computers were at synthesizing music. Now, I plan on using what I learned from the demos in my own projects.</p>||||||use_html=1|

Let&#39;s see, here are a couple from the list of topics we&#39;ve taught this summer: linguistics, acousitics, Python, search, circuits, Game Theory, hippies and hipsters, Frisbee, bridge building, egg drop. And of course, all expenses were paid by MIT.</p>{nl}<p style="text-align: center;">{nl}	<img alt="" src="/blog/uploads/1072455_294909520653379_1402802701_o.jpg" style="width: 510px; height: 340px;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Steven being an awesome teacher.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="/blog/uploads/1075336_297359693741695_738668450_o.jpg" style="width: 512px; display: block; margin: 0px auto; height: 340px; border-width: 1px; border-style: solid;" />Students in Taiwan doing egg drop.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="/blog/uploads/996553_299019343575730_1291349104_n.jpg" style="width: 512px; display: block; margin: 0px auto; height: 340px;" /> Bridge building with Rachel. I am the one with the weirder face.</p>{nl}<p style="text-align: center;">{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	I decided to join CETI instead of doing a UROP or interning at a company, because I came to this school without a very rigid plan of what I wanted to do. I wasn&#39;t one of those people who came in thinking &quot;oh man, I&#39;m going to take 6.042 and 6.004 this term, and I&#39;m going to intern at Palantir this summer, and Google next summer, and Facebook after that summer and get married and have 3 children and name them John, Betty and Chris!&quot; I mean, I knew I wanted to do something that uses technology to improve bio/health, but I kept an open mind about which specific road to take. I didn&#39;t even know much about course 6 until IAP! So when I came across CETI, I figured it would be an excellent summer activity for a frosh like me who didn&#39;t know anything yet. :)</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	I would highly recommend CETI, or any other similar teaching programs that MIT offers such as <a href="http://aiti.mit.edu/">AITI</a> or <a href="http://meet.mit.edu/">MEET</a>, because as cheesy as it sounds, it is true that <em>you</em> learn much more from your experience than you teach. You become a better teacher and a better student. Besides, how often do you get the chance to go eat hotpot, sing KTV, and talk about politics with actual Chinese students of your own age?</p>||||||use_html=1|

(part 1)|<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">Hi everyone! &nbsp;Even though it&#39;s only the second week back in classes, your IEEE/ACM board has already gotten down to business with meetings and planning. &nbsp;We&#39;ve got some great events in store for this semester! &nbsp;Look out for updates on upcoming events to hit your inboxes soon. &nbsp;Once those kick off, I&#39;ll be updating the blog regularly with some awesome pictures and posts of you all hopefully enjoying said events!</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">In the meantime, we wanted to keep this space updated by sharing some of our own summer experiences (be it researching, internships, start-ups, etc.) to introduce ourselves and give a glimpse of the many possibilities that Course VI has to offer! &nbsp;I&#39;ll get us started:</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">I&#39;m Kristin, a Junior in 6-3 and the IEEE/ACM historian. &nbsp;This summer I worked as a software engineering intern on an DARPA program in DC called TransApps. &nbsp;Some things are classified, but I can tell you it was an awesome project making handheld devices and applications for the military to make operations more efficient both in the continental US and overseas. &nbsp;Specifically, I handled database management for geospatial data. &nbsp;The diversity of the people on the project was incredible, as there were so many different teams devoted to different areas of the task. &nbsp;I worked with everyone from my mentor, who co-founded his own software dev company, to the DARPA project manager overseeing our work.</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">For the last week of the summer program, we had an intern hack-a-thon, which was a blast. &nbsp;My team of three developed a wicked cool fitness app for soldiers and won first place(!), though the competition was way fierce. &nbsp;Oh, I should mention that the other interns were totally awesome - I made friends from all up and down the east coast, and those of us from the DC area are planning on having a reunion over winter break. :) &nbsp;We also planned the company picnic for 80+ people, which was crazy, but a huge success. &nbsp;All in all, I learned an incredible amount this summer - I went in basically knowing some Java, and came out with a thorough understanding of mobile development and database processing. &nbsp;Not bad for the equivalent of one semester!</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:14px;">Hope your summers all went fantastically as well!! &nbsp;Here&#39;s to the start of a successful new semester <img alt="smiley" height="17" src="https://ieee.scripts.mit.edu:444/blog/core/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.gif" style="font-size: 12px;" title="smiley" width="17" />&nbsp;</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:12px;">Kristin Asmus</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:12px;">Historian of MIT IEEE/ACM</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:12px;">Class of 2015</span></p>||||||use_html=1|

We are making more progress on our partnership with JKU Linz Partnership we mentioned last time. We have a finalized official proposal (which will be soon posted on our website) of this partnership and have officers and faculty advisors from both schools signed on this proposal. In addition, last Friday, we were honored to have 2013 IEEE Boston Section Chair, Robert Vice came to MIT to discuss the partnership and sign on the proposal. &nbsp;Mr. Vice was very supported of the idea of this partnership and believed that it aligns with IEEE&#39;s original goal of connecting engineers from different regions. He has witnessed success of these types of cross-region partnerships before, and is convinced that the exchange of ideas and resources will be beneficial for both of our branches. In addition to the partnership, we also talked about the ideas for more activities. We are planning to organize a regional meeting among all student branches in Greater Boston Area, and bring the tradition of S-PAC (Student Profession Awareness Conference) back to MIT.</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://web.mit.edu/ylwu/Public/IEEE/Pictures/MIT-JKU.jpg" style="width: 80%;" /></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	<span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-family: 'Helvetica Neue', Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; font-size: 10px; line-height: 14px;">Left to Right: Robert Vice (IEEE Boston 2013 Chair, Bernhard Gruber (JKU IEEE Branch Vice Chairman), Manting Lao (MIT IEEE/ACM Publicity Chair), Jason Wu (MIT IEEE/ACM Faculty Chair)</span></div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	By signing this proposal, we have finished the very important first step in establishing our partnership with JKU Linz. This is also a strong start of our MIT IEEE/ACM&#39;s 2013-2014 school year, and the first of our many efforts to connect with other schools and organizations. We hope to bring exciting events, fresh ideas and new perspectives to our IEEE/ACM members in this coming year; get excited!&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Jason Yonglin Wu</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	Faculty Chair of MIT IEEE/ACM</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	&nbsp;</div>{nl}<div>{nl}	MIT Class of 2015</div>||||||use_html=1|
1375799224|manting|MIT IEEE/ACM Summer Update - JKU Linz Partnership|<p>{nl}	Hello MIT IEEE/ACM!</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	This summer, the MIT IEEE/ACM Student Branch has been working on bringing the MIT and Course 6 community more accessible and exciting events. The coming semester, we plan to host regular dinners with Professors, make several trips to visit and learn about nearby startups, and organize more study breaks and social hours. Additionally, our Webmaster, Donald Little, has redone the MIT IEEE/ACM website! (Isn&#39;t it awesome?&nbsp;<img alt="laugh" height="18" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/core/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/teeth_smile.gif" title="laugh" width="18" />&nbsp;) We will be regularly posting relevant event information, news updates, blogs, and student highlights here.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	In addition to revamping the website this summer, we have also been working on a partnership between our branch and the IEEE Region 8 Johannes Kepler University branch in Linz, Austria. We have met several times with Bernhard Gruber, Vice Chairman of the JKU branch and are now in the final stages of finalizing this partnership.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<img alt="" src="http://mlaoess.files.wordpress.com/2012/03/partnership1.jpg" style="width: 90%; display: block; margin: 0px auto;" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	<span style="font-size:10px;">Left to Right: Bernhard Gruber (JKU IEEE Branch Vice Chairman), Manting Lao (MIT IEEE/ACM Publicity Chair), Jason Wu (MIT IEEE/ACM Faculty Chair)</span></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	You can visit the JKU Linz IEEE Branch&#39;s website at: <a href="http://www.ieee.jku.at/">www.ieee.jku.at/</a></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	We hope that this partnership will establish friendly connections between our two sections and foster communication and international exchange between our IEEE Members. Currently, we are discussing plans for MIT IEEE/ACM Members to attend the IEEE Region 8 Student Branch &amp; GOLD Congress 2014 in Poland. There may also be a trip to CERN with the JKU Branch in the next two years. The MIT branch will be inviting IEEE&nbsp;JKU&nbsp;to conferences in the United States, including the IEEE 2014 Region 1 Student Conference. We will also help host IEEE JKU if they decide to take a trip to MIT. The long-term goal of this partnership will be an exchange-support program for students from either branch who are accepted to study abroad for a few weeks. The host branch will help the exchange student adjust and provide a friendly and welcoming community.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	We hope that this partnership will greatly enhance the networks of both branches across the Atlantic and bring new ideas and novel experiences for our IEEE students. We have received much support from the Boston and Austria IEEE sections and we are all very excited about future prospects! We will be posting the official proposal on the &quot;Partners&quot; page of our website in the next few weeks.</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Stay tuned!&nbsp;<img alt="smiley" height="18" src="http://ieee.scripts.mit.edu/blog/core/ckeditor/plugins/smiley/images/regular_smile.gif" title="smiley" width="18" /></p>{nl}<p>{nl}	&nbsp;</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Manting Lao</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Publicity Chair of MIT IEEE/ACM</p>{nl}<p>{nl}	Class of 2016</p>||||||use_html=1|
